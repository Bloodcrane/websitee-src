The latter speaks on behalf of everyone stuck in the new \r\n                  normality brought on by COVID-19: one day, the world stopped without any warning, streets \r\n                  erased of footsteps and the way out is nowhere near in sight.

Released seven months after \r\n                 that first installment, The most beautiful moment in life pt.2 sings about the\r\n                  energy of youth barreling forward, embracing even the uncertainty and insecurity. \r\n                  Now beginning to taste the bitterness of grown-up life, they can easily sense that life\r\n                   isn`t always beautiful. However, they continue to sprint forward, relying only on \r\n                   their two destitute legs and the fire in their hearts. There’s nothing else to do but\r\n                   keep running. Facing the powerlessness of one’s youth, they collide and shatter and still\r\n                    cry out that “it’s okay to fall, it’s okay to get hurt.” That is the beauty of this moment.\r\n                Continuing the tradition of the previous album, the members including RM, SUGA, j-hope,\r\n                 V and Jung Kook add their names to the producing and songwriting credits, showing their own\r\n                  growth as musicians. The lyrics are more profound and the music more passionate. \r\n                  The “Youth Series” concludes with The most beautiful moment in life pt.2, \r\n                  but the boys are only now on the starting line. “Never Mind”, BTS is just getting started.'\r\n                />\r\n\r\n                <AlbumComponent\r\n                imageUrl=\"https://ibighit.com/bts/images/bts/discography/wings/album-cover.jpg\"\r\n                title=\"WINGS\"\r\n                description='BTS will release their second studio album, WINGS.\r\n                Having met their most beautiful moment in life\r\n                 through the ablum series of the same title, BTS now \r\n                 stands before a new door. Set for release on October 10, \r\n                 WINGS contains songs about boys who encounter temptation for the first\r\n                  time and must ponder and agonize in the face of it. As the seven boys experience pain and bliss, \r\n                they bring forth the image of birds that break out of their shells and try to take flight for the first time.'\r\n                />\r\n\r\n                <AlbumComponent\r\n                imageUrl=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/54/c9/f0/54c9f0d395434b77ae8d28f8ad19c2f9.jpg\"\r\n                title=\"დასასრული\"\r\n                description='რა მაგარია, მოვრჩი!!! ვუჰუუუ 🤩'\r\n                />\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default DiscographyPage"],"names":["LinkLayout","_jsxs","className","children","_jsx","Link","to","Outlet","colors","_ref","imageUrl","title","description","albumStyle","backgroundColor","Math","floor","random","length","style","src","alt","DiscographyPage","AlbumComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
